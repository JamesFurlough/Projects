				<p>Hello, I am James Furlough. I am a software development major, I have been programming for three years, and am hoping to graduate before I turn eighteen. I enjoy all things nerdy, like Dungeons and Dragons or Warhammer 40,000.</p>
				<p class="asideleft">In my 'many' years I have worked on many projects. One of those is here on the right. It wasn't the best game, but it was the first one I finished.</p>

				<img src="images/project_2.png" width="510" height="300" alt="picture of a western 3d game where you fight cacti with guns" class="asideleft">
				<p class="asideright">This is another one of my projects. It was made as a gift to one of my brothers. I learned a lot from this project, especially how to "Improvise, adapt, and overcome."</p>
				
				<p id="conclusion">If game dev sounds like something you want to do the I would reccomend checking out <a href="https://develop.games/" target="_blank">develop.games</a>, which is a step-by-step guide about how to start.</p>
